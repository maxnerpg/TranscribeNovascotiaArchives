# Nova Scotia Archives Theme

#To Change!
A theme for Omeka 2.x, based on Interactive Mechanics’ [Omeka Starter Theme](https://github.com/InteractiveMechanics/omeka-starter-theme).  

This theme was designed for two purposes:
* Built from the ground up to be based on Bootstrap 3.x
* Accomodate the [UIowa Libraries’](https://github.com/ui-libraries) Scriptus plugin, a crowdsourced transcription layer for Omeka.
