# Welcome to [Transcribe @ Nova Scotia Archives](http://transcribe.novascotia.io)

Built using Omeka [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu/) (Zend),
DIYhistory's Scriptus plugin,
and Parts of Transcribe @ Yale's Scriptus Theme

The majority of development has been on themes/NSarchive
Primary efforts have been:
- Implement the requirements and features of the Nova Scotia Archives
- To make the site Bootstrap 3 and RWD compliant
- Resolve issues from other Scriptus Omeka Themes:
  - including developing a set of core features that seperate Scriptus logic from the views
(see themes/NSarchives/functions.php)

Future features include:
OAuth with Google and Facebook
Enable Omeka Tagging
